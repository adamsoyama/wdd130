        <p>I am a <strong>Software Engineering</strong> student at BYU-Idaho with a 
          passion for solving real-world problems through technology. I have a strong 
          foundation in <em>Python, Java and JavaScript</em> and I’m focused on building
          user-centered applications that make a difference.</p>
        <p>I’m always looking for new challenges and ways to grow, whether it’s 
          through personal projects or collaborating on exciting opportunities. 
          When I’m not coding, I’m passionate about <strong>environmental 
          sustainability</strong> and <strong>community outreach</strong>. Feel free to connect with me on 
          <a  href="https://github.com/adamsoyama" target="_blank"><em>GitHub</em></a> for my latest work!</p>
        <p>I am a devoted member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, my commitment to the teachings and principles of the gospel is unwavering. 
          The Church has profoundly shaped my life, providing me with spiritual guidance, a strong sense of community, and a framework 
          for living a Christ-centered life. The temples hold a particularly special place in my heart. They are sacred spaces where members 
          can draw closer to God, perform essential ordinances, and find peace and inspiration. Temples symbolize our commitment to eternal 
          covenants and represent a beacon of faith and devotion to the teachings of Jesus Christ. Among the many beautiful temples, 
          my favorites are:</p>
        <!-- Start of the unordered list of favorite temples-->
          <ul class="box">
            <li><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/details/aba-nigeria-temple?lang=eng" target="_blank">Aba Nigeria Temple</a></li>

          </ul>
        <!-- End of unordered list of favorite temples-->
        <p>These temples not only stand as magnificent structures but also as places where I have felt an immense spiritual connection and a deep sense of peace.</p>

        <p>Port Harcourt, located in Nigeria's Niger Delta, is known as the "Garden City" for its parks and green spaces. It's the capital of Rivers State and a hub for the oil and 
          gas industry. The city features a diverse cultural scene, vibrant markets, and a lively nightlife. It hosts the University of Port Harcourt, international companies, and a 
          busy port vital to the economy. The picturesque waterfront and Port Harcourt Tourist Beach offer serene escapes.</p>
        <p>Founded in 1912 by the British, Port Harcourt has grown into a cultural melting pot, seen in its cuisine, festivals, and daily life. The city is known for events like the 
          Port Harcourt Carnival, with colorful parades and traditional music. Well-connected by road, sea, and air, the Port Harcourt International Airport serves as a major gateway,
