      <p>I am a <strong>Software Engineering</strong> student at BYU-Idaho with a 
        passion for solving real-world problems through technology. I have a strong 
        foundation in <em>Python, Java and JavaScript</em> and I’m focused on building
         user-centered applications that make a difference.</p>
      <p>I’m always looking for new challenges and ways to grow, whether it’s 
        through personal projects or collaborating on exciting opportunities. 
        When I’m not coding, I’m passionate about <strong>environmental 
          sustainability</strong> and <strong>community outreach</strong>.</p>

      <p>Port Harcourt is a bustling city located in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Known as the 
        "Garden City" due to its numerous parks and green spaces, it is the capital of Rivers State 
        and a major hub for Nigeria's oil and gas industry. The city boasts a diverse cultural scene, 
        vibrant markets, and a lively nightlife. It's home to the University of Port Harcourt, several 
        international companies, and a busy port, which plays a vital role in the nation's economy. 
        Despite its industrial activities, Port Harcourt maintains a blend of urban development and 
        natural beauty, making it a unique and dynamic place to live and visit.</p>
