      <p>I am a <strong>Software Engineering</strong> student at BYU-Idaho with a 
        passion for solving real-world problems through technology. I have a strong 
        foundation in <em>Python, Java and JavaScript</em> and I’m focused on building
         user-centered applications that make a difference.</p>
      <p>I’m always looking for new challenges and ways to grow, whether it’s 
        through personal projects or collaborating on exciting opportunities. 
        When I’m not coding, I’m passionate about <strong>environmental 
          sustainability</strong> and <strong>community outreach</strong>. Feel free to connect with me on 
        <a  href="https://github.com/adamsoyama" target="_blank"><em>GitHub</em></a> for my latest work!</p>
      <p>I am a devoted member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, my commitment to the teachings and principles of the gospel is unwavering. 
        The Church has profoundly shaped my life, providing me with spiritual guidance, a strong sense of community, and a framework 
        for living a Christ-centered life. The temples hold a particularly special place in my heart. They are sacred spaces where members 
        can draw closer to God, perform essential ordinances, and find peace and inspiration. Temples symbolize our commitment to eternal 
        covenants and represent a beacon of faith and devotion to the teachings of Jesus Christ. Among the many beautiful temples, 
        my favorites are:</p>
        <!-- Start of the unordered list of favorite temples-->
        <ul class="box">
          <li><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/details/aba-nigeria-temple?lang=eng" target="_blank">Aba Nigeria Temple</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/details/accra-ghana-temple?lang=eng" target="_blank">Accra Ghana Temple</a></li>

        </ul>
        <!-- End of unordered list of favorite temples-->
      <p>These temples not only stand as magnificent structures but also as places where I have felt an immense spiritual connection and a deep sense of peace.</p>

      <img src="images/PHC.jpeg" alt="Port Harcourt City">
      <p>Port Harcourt is a bustling city located in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Known as the 
        "Garden City" due to its numerous parks and green spaces, it is the capital of Rivers State 
        and a major hub for Nigeria's oil and gas industry. The city boasts a diverse cultural scene, 
        vibrant markets, and a lively nightlife. It's home to the University of Port Harcourt, several 
        international companies, and a busy port, which plays a vital role in the nation's economy. 
        Despite its industrial activities, Port Harcourt maintains a blend of urban development and 
        natural beauty, making it a unique and dynamic place to live and visit.</p>
